# Lists
Sometimes we need to use lists, there are three types of lists :
1. `ordered lists` :each item in the list is
numbered.
2. `unordered lists` :begin with a bullet point(the order is not important).
3. `definition lists` : set of terms along with the definitions for each of those terms.

Let's take them one-by-one in details :
* **ordered list** :
created with the `ol` element, and each item in the list is placed between the opening tag and the closing tag of `li` element.It is using numbers and shown like this :

```1. ```

```2. ```

```3. ```

* **unordered list** :
created with the `ul` element, and each item in the list is placed between the opening tag and the closing tag of `li` element.It is using bullets and shown like this :

* 
* 
* 

* **definition list** :
created with the `dl` element and usually
consists of a series of terms and their definitions.Inside the `dI` element there is pairs of `dt` and `dd` elements :

* `dt` contains the term being defined.
* `dd` contains the definition.

## What is the Nested list ?

A second list inside an `li` element to create a sublist or nested list:

# Boxes

**Box dimensions** : we can set our own dimensions by changing these two properities :
* ***width***
* ***height***

**Pixels** is the most popular accurate method we use to control the size of boxes .

## Limiting width

* **min-width** :specifies the smallest size a box can be displayed at when the browser window is narrow.
* **max-width** :specifies the maximum width a box can stretch to when the browser window is wide.

## Limiting height

**min-height** & **max-height** , the same as the width.

## Overflowing content (over flow)

If the content contained within a box is larger than the box itself. It can have one of two values:
1. **hidden** :hides any extra content that does not fit in
the box.

2. **scroll** :adds a scrollbar to the box helps the users to scroll and see the missing content.

## Border, Margin and Padding

* ***Border*** : separates the edge of one box from another.
* ***Margin*** : to create a gap between the borders of two
adjacent boxes.
* *** Padding*** : the space between the border of a box and any
content contained within it.

### Border width
Is used to control the width of a border,the value of this
property can either be given in **pixels** or using one of the
following values:
* thin
* medium
* thick

`border-top-width : thick ;`
`border-left-width : 2px;`

### Border style
This property can take the following values:
(solid,dotted,dashed,double,groove,ridge,inset,outsit,hidden/none)

![border style](https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/lib/images/css-border-style.png)

### Border color
We can specify the color of a border using either ***RGB values***,***hex codes*** or ***CSS color names*** :

`p.one {border-color: #0088dd;}`

## Padding
Specify how much space should appear between the content of an element and its border.

padding-top
padding-right
padding-bottom
padding-left

`padding: 10px 5px 3px 1px;`

## Margin
Controls the gap between boxes.

margin-top
margin-right
margin-bottom
margin-left

`margin: 1px 2px 3px 4px;`

## Centering content
To center a box on the page, we set the left-margin and right-margin to auto.
In order to center a box on the page, you need to set a width
for the box.

## Change inline/block (display)
Allows us to turn an inline element into a block-level element.
The values this property can take are:
(inline,block.inline-block,none).

### Border images
applies an image to the border of any box.

### Box shadows
Allows us to add a drop shadow around a box using these properities :
* Horizontal offset
* Vertical offset
* Blur distance
* Spread of shadow

### Rounded corners 
Create rounded corners on any box, using a property called
**border-radius**.

## Arrays
An array is a special type of variable. It doesn't just store one value; it stores a list of values.
If we don't know how many items a list will contain, rather
than creating enough variables for a long list, using an array is
considered a better solution :

`Example:`
var colors = new Array('white ',
                       'black',
                    'custom ' );
var el = document.getElementByid('colors');
el.innerHTML = colors.item(O);

### Values in arrays :

1. numering the items :
|INDEX| VALUE |
|-----|------ |
|  o  | white |
|  1  | black |
|  2  | custom|
2. accessing the items :
var itemThree;
itemThree = colors [ 2] ;
3. number of items in an array :
The name of the array is followed by a period symbol which is then followed by the 1 ength keyword.
`example:`

var numColors ;
numColors =col ors. length;

## Decisions and Loops

**How to create and control the flow of data in your scripts to handle different situations?**

following these three concepts :
1. ***evaluations***.
2. ***decisions***.
3. ***loops***.

### Decision Making :
![decision making](https://www.tutorialandexample.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Decision-Making-in-ES6-1.png)

### Evaluating conditions and conditional statements
The decision is made of two parts :
1. evaluated expression which returns a value.
2. conditional statement say what to do in a given situation.

`example:`
if (hour < 18) {
  greeting = "Good day";
} else {
  greeting = "Good evening";
}

### coparison operators
The result will be boolean:(true or false), we use the operators: 1. `==` or `!=` to compare the value :
`example:`
' book'=='apple' ? that's false.
2. `===` or `!==` to compare both the value and the type :
`example:`
'3' === 3 ? that's  true .
3. `<` , `>` , `<=` and `>=`

## If-else statements
if ... e 1 se statement allows us to provide two sets of code:
1. one set if the condition evaluates to true.
2. another set if the condition is false.

## Switch statement
A way of checking a condition, which has a better performance than if-else statement because when the code is run and a match is found then the break statement stops the rest statements.
`example:`
int day = 2;
switch (day) {
  case 1:
    System.out.println("Monday");
    break;
  case 2:
    System.out.println("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 3:
    System.out.println("Wednesday");}
    break;

    here the output is "Tuesday" (day 2)

## Truthy & Falsy values 
**Falsy** values are treated as if they are false.
**Truthy** values are treated as if they are true.
`examples:`

![truthy & falsy](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/icFC_IorUdR1SF5cioEDejabHn0byamsL4x_5kTv2upylrUsJsLJw8eZTpmQiANgVzoJhqx12kDS0cHqwSmKWXxOnDNw66LuZ-ImXaEgxXRT5ybVS5G0A31Io-cZem6NIsRZKTaV)

## Looping
There are many types of loops :
1. **For** loop : we know how many times the loop will be enterd
2. **While** loop : we don't know how many times the loop will be enterd.
3. **Do-while** loop

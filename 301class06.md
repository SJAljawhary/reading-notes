#### What is node.js?
**Node.js** is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
Also we can say **Node.js** is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

#### In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
V8 is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others. It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors. V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.

#### What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
When we say that Node is built on the V8 engine, we don’t mean that Node programs are executed in a browser. They aren’t. Rather, the creator of Node (Ryan Dahl) took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods.

**Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers**.

#### What is npm?
**npm** is the world's largest Software Library,
it's a **package manager** and installer that comes bundled with Node.

#### What version of node are you running on your machine?
`v12.22.1`

#### What version of npm are you running on your machine?
`6.14.12`

#### What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?
`npm install -g jshint`

#### What is node used for?
**Installing (via npm) and running (via Node) various build tools — designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.**
These **build tools** come in all shapes and sizes, and you won’t get far in a modern JavaScript landscape without bumping into them. They can be used for anything from bundling your JavaScript files and dependencies into static assets, to running tests, or automatic code linting and style checking.

## Pair Programming

#### What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

#### In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
Learning from another students so that the social skills become better and also have a greater efficiency in doing the programming.

#### How does pair programming work?
While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly **involves two roles: the `Driver` and the `Navigator`**. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.

# Component-Based Architecture
Component-based architecture focuses on the decomposition of the design into individual functional or logical components that represent well-defined communication interfaces containing methods, events, and properties. It provides a higher level of abstraction and *divides the problem into sub-problems*, each associated with component partitions.

The primary objective of component-based architecture is to ensure **component reusability**. A component encapsulates functionality and behaviors of a software element into a reusable and self-deployable binary unit. There are many standard component frameworks such as `COM/DCOM, JavaBean, EJB, CORBA, .NET, web services, and grid services`. These technologies are widely used in local desktop GUI application design such as graphic JavaBean components, MS ActiveX components, and COM components which can be reused by simply drag and drop operation.

##### Component-oriented software design has many advantages over the traditional object-oriented approaches such as :

* Reduced time in market and the development cost by reusing existing components.
* Increased reliability with the reuse of the existing components.

### What is a Component?
A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

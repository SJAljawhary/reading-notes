## How to choose the suitable text editor ??

Can you use the text editor that you like to make a complete web site successfully and to your satisfaction? 
Clearly the text editor you’ve chosen got the
job done,some text editing software comes with features that other text editing software does not, but for the most part, they’re all pretty similar.

extensions available when you need them**.

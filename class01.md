# Creating web pages
We will learn how to use the **HTML** and **CSS** to create or build and design the web pages in details.

The first thing we will look at before coding is : 
## How people access the web pages ?
1. ***Web browsers*** : such as Firefox , Internet Explorer , Chrome and many other browsers.
2. ***Web servers*** : are special computers that are constantly
connected to the Internet, and are optimized to send web pagesout to people who request them.
3. ***Devices*** : many devices are used to reach the websites including desktop computers,laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. these devices have different screen sizes and some have faster connections to the web than others.
4. ***Screen readers*** : are programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user. 

## How Websites are created ?
As we know each website has images , video , audio in addition to the writtin paragraphs , these elements is added by many programming languages such as HTML and CSS:the
web browser interprets the HTML and CSS code to create the page that you see.

## Structuring word documents
Each document uses heading and subheadings to explain it's topics in order to have the perfect , easy readable structure.

As we learned before, the **HTML** is used to describe the structure of pages , it consists of many elments wich made of two tags : ***(opening tag , closing tag)***, each tag is a container which contains specific information inside it.

### Attributes

They give us more information about the element's contents,they are located in the opening tag and consists of : a **name** and a **value**:
`<img src=" " > <img>`

### Body,Head and Title

* Body : Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.
* Head : This contains information about the page.
* Title : This shown in the top of the browser,allow you to view multiple pages at the same time.

## Extra Markup
There have been several different versions of HTML such : (**HTML4**),(**XHTML 1.0**) and (**HTML5**),each new version was designed to be an improvement on the last. There also have been several versions of each browser used to view web pages, each of which implements new code.
The ***DOCTYPE*** declaration is used  to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using.

### ID Attribute 
Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to
uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page: `<p id="pullquote"></p>`

### Class Attribute
Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute sometimes, to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page:
`<p class="important admittance"></p>`

### Grouping texts and elements in a block
The **<div>** element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.
### Grouping texts and elements inline
The **<span>** element acts like an inline equivalent of the <div> element. It is used to either:
* Contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from it's surrounding text.
* Contain a number of inline elements.

### iframe
**<iframes>** cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.
### meta
The **<meta>** tag allows you to supply all kinds of information about your web page.

### Escape characters 
Escape charactersare used to include special characters in your pages such as <, >, and ©.


### HTML layouts 
***HTML5*** introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them.

### Headers and footers
The **<header>** and **<footer>** elements can be used for:

● The main header or footer that appears at the top or
bottom of every page on the site.
● A header or footer for an individual <article> or <section> within the page.

### Navigation
The **<nav>** element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

### Articles
The **<article>** element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated.

### Sections
The **<section>** element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.

### Heading groups
The purpose of the **<hgroup>** element is to group together a set of one or more <h1> through <h6> elements so that they are treated as one single heading.


## Proccess and Design

After we finished the structure of our website , we need to proccess and design it , many things should be known :

1. ***who is the site for***,it's very important to understand who our target audience is:
* the age.
* the country.
* the level of education.
* is it for men,women,etc.

2. ***why people visit our website***, some people will simply chance across our website, most will visit for a specific reason.

3. **what information the nedd**,in order to achieve their goals quickly and effectively.

4. **how often people will visit our site**,gives us an indication for how often we should update the site.

### Site Map 
to organize the information into sections or pages :

### Wireframes
a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require :

![wireframe](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/47/Profilewireframe.png/220px-Profilewireframe.png)

### Visual hierarchy 

it refers to the order in which your eyes perceive what
they see. It is created by adding visual contrast between the items being displayed :
* `size` .
* `color` .
* `style` .

### Grouping and similarity

to organize visual elements into groups. Grouping related pieces of information together can make a design easier to comprehend. Here are some ways this can be achieved :
* ***proximity*** .
* ***closure*** .
* ***continuace*** .
* ***white space*** .
* ***color***.
* ***borders***.

### Designing Navigation 
helps people to find where they want to go, understand what our site is about and how it is organized.
Good navigation tends to follow these principles:
* `concise`.
* `clear`.
* `selective`.
* `context`.
* `interactive`.
* `consistent`.


## Javascript

Javascript is used in browsers to make websites more interactive, interesting, and user-friendly.

### 1. what is a script and how do I create one?

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow and run ***step-by-step*** to achieve a goal.
To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it, they can be represented using the **Flowchart**:

![flowchart](https://cacoo.com/wp-app/uploads/2020/07/basic-flowchart-template@2x.png)

 
### 2. how do computers fit in with the world around them?

Programmers create a very different kind of model especially for computers, using **data** so the computers follow the instructions we give it to carry out its tasks. 

#### Objects and properities :

In computer programming, each physical thing in the world can be represented as an ***object***, each object has it's own charactaristics(properetites):
* name.
* color.
* model, etc .

![object](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KOCWIOnStaQ/maxresdefault.jpg)

#### Events


Programmers choose which events they respond to. 
When a specific event happens, that event can be 
used to trigger a specific section of the code. 
Scripts often use different events to trigger different 
types of functionality. 

#### Methods

The code for a method can contain lots of instructions that together represent one task. 
When we use a method, we do not always need to know how it achieves its task; we just need to know how to ask the question and how to interpret any answers it gives us.

#### Putting them all toghether 

**Computers** use data to create models of things in the real world. The events, methods, and properties of an object all relate to each other: 
Events can trigger methods, and methods can retrieve or update an object's properties. 

### 3. how do we write a script for a web page?

Web developers usually talk about three languages that 
are used to create web pages: 
* **HTML**. 
* **CSS**.
* **JavaScript**. 

The HTML <script> element is used in HTML pages to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like 
the <link> element can be used to load a CSS file). 

When the browser comes across a <script> element, it stops to load the script and then checks to see if it needs to do anything.

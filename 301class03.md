## Passing Functions as Props

### What does .map() return?
The **map()** is a method creates a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.the array will be the same lenght of the origin one .Links to an external site.


### If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
We can build a collection of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces {}.and we loop through this array using the JavaScript **map() function**.


### Each list item needs a unique _(key)_.
A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating list of elements.

### What is the purpose of a key?
Keys are used to React to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted. In other words, we can say that keys are used to give an identity to the elements in the lists.


## The Spread Operator

### What is the spread operator?
The spread operator is a useful and quick syntax for adding items to arrays, combining arrays or objects, and spreading an array out into a function’s arguments. InJavaScript, spread syntax refers to the use of an ellipsis of three dots (…) to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.(it **‘expands’ an iterable object arr into the list of arguments**.)


### List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
* Copying an array.
* Concatenating or combining arrays.
* Using Math functions.
* Using an array as arguments.



### Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.
As seen in the last example, the spread operator can quickly combine two arrays, an operation known as array concatenation:

### Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.
As noted in the last example, the spread operator can add an item to an another array with a natural, easy-to-understand syntax:

`const fewFruit = ['🍏','🍊','🍌']
const fewMoreFruit = ['🍉', '🍍', ...fewFruit]
console.log(fewMoreFruit) //  Array(5) [ "🍉", "🍍", "🍏", "🍊", "🍌" ]`


### Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.
The spread syntax is useful for combining the properties and methods on objects into a new object:

`
const objectOne = {hello: "🤪"}
const objectTwo = {world: "🐻"}
const objectThree = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: "😂"}
console.log(objectThree) // Object { hello: "🤪", world: "🐻", laugh: "😂" }
const objectFour = {...objectOne, ...objectTwo, laugh: () => {console.log("😂".repeat(5))}}
objectFour.laugh() // 😂😂😂😂😂`


## How to Pass Functions Between Components


### In the video, what is the first step that the developer does to pass functions between components?
Create a function wherever the state is changed.


### In your own words, what does the increment function do?
When the function loops through the array using map method it increases 'one' each time it loops .


### How can you pass a method from a parent component into a child component?
Pass it with props.


### How does the child component invoke a method that was passed to it from a parent component?
Call the methot that was passed as props, will invoke the state method and pass the data.

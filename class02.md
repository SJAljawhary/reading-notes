## Headings
HTML has six "levels" of headings:
`h1` is used for main headings.
`h2` is used for subheadings.
If there are further sections under the subheadings then the
`h3` element is used, and so on...

## Paragraphs
To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening `p`
tag and closing `/p` tag.

### Bold and Italic
By enclosing words in the tags `b` and `/b` we can make characters appear **bold**.

By enclosing words in the tags `i` and `/i` we can make characters appear *italic*.

## Superscript and Subscript
1. superscript :The `sup` element is used
to contain characters that should be superscript like raising a number to a power 5^2.
2. subscript :The `sub` element is used to contain characters that should be subscript. It is commonly used with chemical formulas such as H20.

## Line breaks and horizantal rules
If we wanted to add a line break inside the
middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag `br /`.

To create a break between themes we can add a
horizontal rule between sections using the `hr /` tag.

## Strong and Emphasis 
* The use of the `strong` element indicates that its content has strong importance.
* The `em` element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence, and it will be shown in *Italic*. 

## Quotations
1. `blockquote` : used for longer quotes.
2. `q` : used for shorter qoutes.

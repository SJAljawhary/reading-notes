# Comparison Operators :
## Evaluating conditions

There are many operators we can use to compare two values or more
together :

1. is equal to ``==`` : to see if they are the same.
2. is ~~not~~ equal to ``!=`` : to see if they are not the same.
3. strict equal to ``===`` : to check that both (**data type**&**value)
are the same.
4. strict ~~not~~ equal to : to check that both (**data type**&**value) are ~~not~~ the same.
5. greater than ``>`` : to check if the number on the left is greater
than the number on the right.
6. less than ``<`` :  to check if the number on the left is less
than the number on the right.
7. greater than or equal ``>=`` : to check if the number on the left is 
greater than or equal the number on the right.
8. less than or equal ``<=`` : to check if the number on the left is 
less than or equal the number on the right.

These orerators return single value of **true** or **false**,but the 
logical ones allow you to compare the results of more than one 
comparison operator,let's see:

A single value of **true** or **false** usually returns by doing
the comparison operator, and if there are more than one comparison operator.

                     
## Logical operators :
1. logical **AND** ``&&`` : If ***both*** expressions **equals true** then the 
expression **returns true**:

|comparesion|Result|
                       |-----------|------|
                       |T&T        |T     |
                       |F&F        |F     |
                       |T&F        |F     |
                       |F&T        |F     |                       

2. logical **OR** ``||`` : ***If any of*** them **equals true** then the exprression
**returns true** , If ***both equal false*** then it will **return false**:
      
|comparesion|Result|
                       |-----------|------|
                       |T&T        |T     |
                       |F&F        |F     |
                       |T&F        |T     |
                       |F&T        |T     |                       

                       
3. logical **NOT** ``!`` : This one inverts the single boolean value so the **true
becomes false** and the **false becomes true** .


 

## Loops
1. **FOR** loop :when the ***number of times*** the code will run is **known** .
2. **While** loop :when the ***number of times*** the code will run is **unknown** .
3. **Do While** loop :run the code **also when the condition equals false** .

### Loop counters :
1. **Initialization** : `var i=0;`
2. **Condition** : `i<5`
3. **Update** : `i++`

  # Desig a website

When we are going to create a website we need to :
-use suitable programming language.
-edit it's structure to be a valuable one.

So fist let's talk about one of the programming languages,
which called **HTML**.

## What is HTML ??
It's a hyper text and markeup language which linkes 
can be connected together and the tags can be converted to
to *texts* , *images* and etc.

## Which version should we use ??
There are many versions of **HTML** , so when we to create
a web we should which version we will use , and it's better 
to use a new version which will have new elements .
The **DOCTYPE** declaration tell the browser which version the page is using .

## HTML contains :
1. #### many elements:
  * inline elememts.
  * block elements.

2. #### attributes:
  * src.
  * href.

3. #### tags :
  * <p>.
  * <div> .
  * <meta> .
  * <iframe> .

 

All of these elements and tags are mentiond between these three main components of any **HTML** web :
1. **header** : contains the main heading and navigation.
2. **main** : contains articles which contains sections.
3. **footer** : may contains the copyrights or anything also.

Now after we added the texts and paraghraphs we should give this website a beautiful and valuable structure .
Firstly,we need to know some imformation like:
 #### 1. who is the site for:
  -the age range.
  -the country and etc.

#### 2.Why people visit our website.
#### 3.What they are trying to achieve.
#### 4.What information they need.

## The structure stage :

All of these information can be structured in a ***Site Map*** :

Now the **first step** we should do is to sketch the website ***Wirefram*** :

which contains the web *elements* and how it will organized.
Some important things should be indicated for example :*size*,*color* and *style* , also we can use grouping and similarity to helpsimplify our information.

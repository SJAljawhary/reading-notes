# JavaScript 

## How the web pages being more interactive with JavaScript?

**JavaScript** makes the web pages more interactive by " **accessing**:select and find 
out elements and texts for example " & " **modifying**: add or change something on it"
the content used in any web page while it's being viewed in th browser, so we can:
-Access
-Modify
-Program
-React

## HTML & CSS
HTML elements are added to a content of a page to describe it's structure, they consists 
of the begining and the closing tags in addition to it's content,tags come between the
opening tag wich carry the ***atribute*** and the closing one:


             <img src= " " alt=" "></img>


CSS uses rules to indicate how the contents of the elements will be displayed in
the browser :

              .car {color:blue;}

## What is a script ?
It's a series of instructions that a computer can follow step-by-step to achieve a goal,
and we can design it after defining the goals of using it.

##Expressions

Results in a single value,they are two types :
1. one which only assign a value to a variable :

               var type= 'BMW;'

2. the another that use two or more values to return a single 

               var area=4*5;

##Operators 
They allow the programmers to create a single value from one or more values such as :
1. **assignment operators** :
 ``area=5*6;``
2. **comparison operators** :
 ``( < , > , <= , >= )``,
 ex: ``age >= 24``
3. **string operators** : combine two strings:
             ``name='Lama '+'Ahmad'``
4. **logical operators** : combine expressions and return true or false 
5. **arithmetic operators** : do mathmetic statments

Order of execution will be applied.
6. **string operator** : the **+** symbol :

``var firstName='Ahmad';``
``var lastName='Salah';``
``var fullName= firstName  + lastName;`` 
it will give the result : ** 'Ahmad Salah'**

#### Mixing numbers and strings together :

1. for : 
``var x= '5';``
        ``var y= '6';``
        ``var total = x + y;`` , the result is **'56'**

2. for :
``var num= 5;``
``var name='hadeel';``
``var add= num + name;`` , the result is **5hadeel**

3. for :
``var num1='one';``
``var num2='two';``
``var sum= num1 + num2;`` , the result is **NaN**



## Basic Function
We use *function* to make our program more clarity
and readable.

### 1. Declaring a Function
It contains the function keyword , function name and the code 
block replaces in a curly braces:

``function sayHello(){``
``document.write('Hello);}``

### 2. Calling a function
after the function has been declared ,the statments between it's curly braces will be executed with just one line of code : ``sayHello();``

### 3. Declaring functions that need information
when the function need specific information to perform its task, so *parameters* should be included and they act like variables.
 

 ``function Area(width,height){``
 ``}return width * height;``

 We should specify the values which is needed in the parameters:

 1. as values :
 ``Area(5,4);``
 2. as variables :
 ``x=5;``
 ``y=4;``
 ``Area(x,y);``

 Then we use **return Area;** to return the result

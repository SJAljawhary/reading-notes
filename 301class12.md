##  Mongo and Mongoose

### Five differences between **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases :


|SQL|NoSQL|
|---|---|
|databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS|NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database|
|databases are table based databases|atabases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores|
|databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful|queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database|
|databases are vertically scalable|NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable|
|databases have predefined schema|databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data|

### 1.What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment.


### 2.Give a real world example.
Replication: By replicating MySQL database across multiple nodes the work load can be reduced heavily increasing the scalability and availability of business application.


### 3.What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
Databases are not good fit for complex queries. On a high-level, NoSQL don’t have standard interfaces to perform complex queries, and the queries themselves in NoSQL are not as powerful as SQL query language.


### 4.Give a real world example.
Memcached as a NoSQL API to MySQL: Memcached can be used to increase the performance of the data retrieval operations giving an advantage of NoSQL api to MySQL server.


### 5.Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
NoSQL.

### 6.Which type of database is best for scalability?
SQL.

## SQL vs NoSQL

### 1.What does SQL stand for?
Structured Query Language.

### 2.What is a realational database?
It's a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

### 3.What type of structure does a relational database work with?
B-TREE ,collection of tables, each having a unique name. A row in a table represents a relationship among a set of values. Thus a table represents a collection of relationships. There is a direct correspondence between the concept of a table and the mathematical concept of a relation.

### 4.What is a ‘schema’?
The term “schema” refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed (divided into database tables in the case of relational databases). The formal definition of a database schema is a set of formulas (sentences) called integrity constraints imposed on a database.


### 5.What is a NoSQL database?
It's an approach to database design that provides flexible schemas for the storage and retrieval of data beyond the traditional table structures found in relational database.

### 6.Howo does it work?
Each type of NoSQL database would be designed with a specific customer situation in mind, and there would be technical reasons for how each kind of database would be organized. The simplest type to describe is the document database, in which it would be natural to combine both the basic information and the customer information in one JSON document. In this case, each of the SQL column attributes would be fields and the details of a customer’s record would be the data values associated with each field.

### 7.What is inside of a Mongo database?
MongoDB stores data records as documents which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.

### 8.Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
**MongoDB** because it  provides a flexible developer interface for teams that are building applications that don’t need all of the safety features offered by relational systems. A common example of such an application is a web application that doesn’t depend on structured schemas; it can easily serve unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data, all from the same MongoDB collection.

### 9.What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
don’t have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don’t support ACID).

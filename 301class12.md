##  Mongo and Mongoose

### Five differences between **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases :
|SQL|NoSQL|
|---|---|
|databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS|NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database|
|databases are table based databases|atabases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores|
|databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful|queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database|
|databases are vertically scalable|NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable|
|databases have predefined schema|databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data|

### 1.What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment.


### 2.Give a real world example.
Replication: By replicating MySQL database across multiple nodes the work load can be reduced heavily increasing the scalability and availability of business application.


### 3.What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
Databases are not good fit for complex queries. On a high-level, NoSQL donâ€™t have standard interfaces to perform complex queries, and the queries themselves in NoSQL are not as powerful as SQL query language.


### 4.Give a real world example.
Memcached as a NoSQL API to MySQL: Memcached can be used to increase the performance of the data retrieval operations giving an advantage of NoSQL api to MySQL server.


### 5.Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
NoSQL.

### 6.Which type of database is best for scalability?
SQL.

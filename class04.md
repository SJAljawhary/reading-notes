# Links
links created bu using `a`element which contains the **href** attribute to specify the page we want to link it with our main page.

## Directory structure
We can organize the **structure** of our code files using a folder for each different section. The family tree describes the **relationship** between these files and folders. 
The **homepage** is written in HTML and called **index.html**.

## Relative URLS
If all of the files in our site are in one folder, we use the file name for that page to give the relative URL for it.

## Email links

We use `mailto` to create a link that contains the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, we use the `a`
element:

`<a href="mailto:sondos@example.org">Email sondos</a>`

### Opening links in a new window
We use `target` to open the link in a new window:

`<a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">
Google</a> (opens in new window)` :

Google(opens in new window)

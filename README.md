We will talk about two control systems :

  2. **GIT** .
  3. **Design a website using HTML**.
  Follow the links in the table bellow .
  

  know lets talk about the **Fixed mindset** and the **Growth mindset** .

**“fixed mindset”** assumes that our character, intelligence, and creative ability are static givens which we can’t change in any meaningful way.

**“growth mindset”** on the other hand, thrives on challenge and sees failure not as evidence of unintelligence but as a heartening springboard for growth and for stretching our existing abilities.

### Foreground color
We can specify any color in CSS by one of these three ways:
1. *RGB values* :how much *(red,green and blue)* used to make it up:`rgb(100,90,100)` .
2. *HEX code* :six digits also indicates how much *(red,green and blue)* used to make it up : `#ee3e80`
3. *Color name* : there are 147 different color names :
`DarkCyan`.

### Background color

CSS treats each HTML element as if it appears in a box, and the background-color property sets the color of the background for that box.
If you didn't specify a color for the background, it will be white for default.

We can use th **color picker** in image editing programs to choose our wanted color.

### Contrast
It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast (between the foreground and the background) for the text to be legible :

### Opacity
The value is a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (so a value of 0.5 is 50% opacity and 0.15 is 15% opacity).

### HSL colors

It's an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using **hue**, **saturation**, and **lightness** values:

1. hue value :represented as a color circle where the angle represents the color.


2. saturation value :aturation is the amount of gray in a color. Saturation is represented as a percentage. **100% is full saturation** and **0% is a shade of gray**.

3. lightness :lightness is the amount of **white (lightness)** or **black (darkness)** in a color. Lightness is represented as a *percentage*. **0%** lightness is **black**, **100%** lightness is **white**, and **50%** lightness is **normal**.

### HSL & HSLA
 The value of the property starts with the letters hsl followed by individual values inside parentheses for
(hue,saturation,lightness): 

``background-color: hsl(0,0%,78%);}``

### Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
 **Render** happens first then the **componentDidMount**.

### What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
**Mounting**.
When an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM it occurs during the mounting phase. Constructor, **static getDerivedStateFromProps, render, componentDidMount, and UNSAFE_componentWillMount** all occur in this order during mounting.

### Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates?
1.constructor >> 2.render >> 3.componentDidMount >> 4.React Updates >> 5.componentWillUnmount.

### What does componentDidMount do?
This method is invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, don’t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount().
setState() can be called here, but it should be used sparingly, because it will cause a rerender, which can lead to perfomance issues.

### What types of things can you pass in the props?
Think of props as **arguments to a function**. Typically when you have a piece of code that you would like to reuse, you can place that code into a function and any dynamic values that code used before can be accepted as arguments and passed using props.


### What is the big difference between props and state?
In a React component, **props** are variables passed to it by its parent component. **State** on the other hand is still variables, but directly initialized and managed by the component.

**The state can be initialized by props**.

### When do we re-render our application?
**When you change the state inside of your application** it’s going to re-render that part of your application while props we can’t acually change them we need to do it outside.

### What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
1-Counter Application.
2-Forms(input element, check box, select boc).

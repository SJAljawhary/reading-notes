# Writing a script for a web page.

## How HTML,CSS & JAVASCRIPT fit together ?
As we mentioned before there is three different languages
we can use in programming :
*HTML: add **semantics** & give the **body**.
*CSS: how the page looks(backroungs,colors,etc).
*JAVASCRIPT "which we will talk about tody": It's a language
that allow us to have the interaction with the user,so
we can change the page's behaviour.

They complete each other ,while **HTML** focus on the content,
CSS focus on the **structure** and JS gives the interaction with
the site.

## How JS working ??
After creating the JS file and give it it's name and the ".js" expantion,
we will link **HTML** page  to this JS file by using <script> "added it befor
 </body>" element to tell the browser that script JS is using now .

### How to use objects and methods ?

                        `console.log();`

Now the first thing `<script></script>` must be added before </body> element
in the **HTML** file so the browser will check the script to see if it needs to do anything.

Java script language contains these fixed elements:
1. statements with different variable values,for example :

               `var age = '25'; `
               `var username = 'lama'; `
2 . comments,for example :
      
                `//create a new date object`

The data stored in **var** will run each time the script runs,
and it consists of : **var** & **quantity** and equals e variable
value.

## The data types :
1. **Number data type = 0.35 ** :

                `var age=50;`

2. **String data type = 'math'** :

                 `var study =math;`

3. **Boolean data type =true** :

                `var football;
                 football = true;`

## Role of naming variables :
1. name **must** start with a **letter,$,_** .
2. name **musn't** start with **namber**.
3. **can;t** use **keywords** and **reserved** words.
4. each variable **must** have it's own name.
5. the used name describs the kind of information that var stores.
6. use a capital letter if the var name made of more than one word : **FirstName**

## What makes a computer , a copmuter ?
Computers are everywhere, in peoples puckets,cars,etc
so let know how does it really work.
There are many tools and inventions help us with manual work,
so what if a machine has been invinted to help with thinking work ?

First,take **INPUT** then **STORE** information after that **PROCESSING** 
and finally give the results '**OUTPUT**', so we have 4 parts :
1. ***input*** : tell the computer what to do using keyboard,mouse,
camera,touch screen.
2. & 3.  ***Storage & Processing*** : the inputed information stored in memory so the 
computers processor takes them from memory and applied a series of command
which called "Algorithm" and then sent them to the memory again and now they
are ready to go out in the shape of output, so this is done by **MEMORY**&**CPU**.
4. ***Output*** : the output information depends on what is the computer is 
designed to do, and when the computer connects to the internet the output
from one computer becomes an input to another.

## How does **elecricity** used to work the computers ?
Computers work on **Ones**&**Zeroes** , inside the computer there are a connected 
wires and circuits that carry all the information in the computer,so how do we store 
these information using the electricity ?
The single wire have elecricity flowing throw it the single will be either **ON**or**OFF**
so this can represent **YES/NO** or **TRUE/FALSE** or **1/0**, and this the smallest
 piece of information a computer can store and it's calld **BIT**,so when we use more wires 
we will get more bits which results more complex information , this system is called the 
**binarynumber system** which we can use to represent any number we want.

### What about other types of information ?
like text,image,and sound ? All of them also can be represented with numbers

**Text in Binary** :

## The electrical circuits depends on the logic gates :
-AND.
-NOT.
-OR.
-NAND.
-NOR.
-XOR.
Which connected together to perform more complex calculations.

### Why the smallest computers is faster ?
Because the small the circuit is the less distance does the signal 
has to go.


The earliest computers were made of metal and mechanical gears,
then they started to use electrical compounds and they were very
large and very slow but now they are fast so we can use it to talk 
to each other,play games,control robots and do any crazy thing we want!

## Hardware and software :
Inside the computer device there are many circuits,chips,wires,speakers,plugs and stuff 
and this is the **hardware** , althoug the **software** is what we don't see , it's all 
the computer programes and codes running in this machine like : apps,games,websites,maps,
analysis and creative.

### How they are connected together ?
CPU which mean the Central Processing Unit ,it's the master chip that controls all the 
other parts of the computer , it consists of smaller simple parts with specific specification.

CPU knows which circuits to use and when !!
Since the binary system is stored in the memory the CPU store the command and senddesired them
to the MEMORY to do the desired operation and then back to the CPU again.
The Binary system conrols all the hardware of the computer, now the programming uses new languages :
1. PYTHON .
2. RUBY.
3. BLOCKLY.
Then the software tells the CPU what to do by using the OPERATING SYSTEM when we do multiple actions like music,
browse and chat !So the **OS** manage the software.
